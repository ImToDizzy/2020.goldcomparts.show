It utilizes various methods; including Markov Chains, openCV, and chance to create its compositions. While AGA might be seen as an extension of the artists' hand, it actually stands between tool and agency. With the influx of hobby robotics, and the accessibility to faster computation the future of art will surely be accompanied by helping hands we've built. The legacy artists will leave behind, may in fact be systems of creation rather than the creations themselves; systems that will produce art the artist will never see. This project investigates co-production, serendipity, and the translation of form from one to another.</p>\n","events":[]}
