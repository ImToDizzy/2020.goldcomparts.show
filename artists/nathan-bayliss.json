Through the interweaving of these strands his work asks:  how can we better understand the technologies that invisibly reconfigure contemporary life? And how may these technologies be re-purposed to tell down to earth, personal stories.</p>\n<p>Born in Australia, Nathan Bayliss moved to London in 2008 and now works from a studio in Hackney, East London. His work Dubrovnik Ghost Series has been featured at Somerset House (HDI Workshop: ‘Art, AI-created content, &amp; industrial/cultural effects’, 2019) and he is exhibiting Robin Hood Gardens: Rewound at Trajectories III, Watermans Gallery, October 2020.</p>\n"}
