His work is developed collaboratively using improvisation.</p>\n<p>His early community-based theater pieces were generated and performed by LGBT homeless youth, guided by a team of theater professionals under the name, <em>“Fringe Benefits”</em>. As a solo performance artist, Ernie appropriated and deconstructed Hollywood narratives of rugged masculinity.</p>\n<p>Ernie’s recent work continues to resist the dominant paradigms of American culture. He explores explicitly political content such as racism or noise pollution as well as more abstract themes such as human/machine collaboration and the illusion of self. In addition to live performance, Ernie creates generative art, prints, and video.</p>\n","events":[{"startTime":"2020-09-20T16:00:00.000Z","duration":45,"livestream":true,"physical":null,"title":"Artist Q&A - Performative : Bodies in Relation","username":"ckarp001,kokpo001,elafk001","themes":"Bodies in Relation","medium":"Live Q&A with artists","desc":"An opportunity to watch demonstrations of our artist's work alongside in-depth insight into their process.
