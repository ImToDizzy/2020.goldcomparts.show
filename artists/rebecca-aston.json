Memory and temporality are central to her art practice, both as subject matter and as medium â€” namely capture technologies, computation and the moving image. In addition to engaging with symbolic and narrative elements, she works on the level of the affective and perceptual, thinking about visceral responses to light, sound, motion and color. As a Zimbabwean artist, she questions narratives of whiteness, especially within settler colonial identities and the empires that bred them; Zimbabwean history is central source material in much of her work. Rebecca is an artist and creative technologist, within both her commercial and artistic work she utilizes a range of technologies, from the web to virtual reality. Born and raised in Zimbabwe, she is currently based in London. She lived and worked as a web developer in the USA after obtaining a BA in Fine Art from Yale.</p>\n","events":[{"startTime":"2020-09-17T17:20:00.000Z","duration":10,"livestream":false,"physical":"yes","title":"Ground","username":"rasto001","themes":"Experiential array, Non-directional travel, Memory bank","medium":"VR","desc":"Grounded in a shifting terrain, living in the sediments of the past, disorientation becomes the only thing to hold onto.
