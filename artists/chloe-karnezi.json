This piece explores what constitutes an “acceptable” representation of women’s bodies in the age of online censorship and strict beauty ideals. Many of us see our bodies featured on screens more often than mirrors, meaning our perception of our physical selves feels tethered to the unintentional and intentional distortions of digital technologies.</p>\n<p>The artist trained a machine learning (ML) model on a dataset of images of her nude body, then asked it, “What does my body look like?” The longer the ML model is trained, the more accurate its answer will be. These images are the machine’s answer. They are the result of a series of questions: “How long would you dare to train the ML model before the images of your body become too accurate for comfort?” “How long before the resulting nude becomes too explicit to avoid online censorship?” The towering fleshy bodies of “Digitised Dysmorphia” are not clear enough to be recognised as belonging to one specific person, yet everyone is able to recognise something of themselves in the marks, blemishes, and folds. These are not elements of an unacceptable body, but of one that has been made to be seen as such.</p>\n","events":[{"startTime":"2020-09-20T13:30:00.000Z","duration":45,"livestream":true,"physical":false,"title":"Artist Q&A - Memory Bank","username":"vjuss001,hkarn001,jchen002","themes":"Memory Bank","medium":"Live Q&A with artists","desc":"An opportunity to watch demonstrations of our artist's work alongside in-depth insight into their process.
