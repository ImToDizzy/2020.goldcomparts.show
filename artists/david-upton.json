He embraces the digital world because it offers him such a range of new opportunities.</p>\n<p>After starting his career in the UK Foreign Office, he built up, with some friends, a small, specialised, management consultancy company, which organised crisis simulation exercises all over the world, for several of the world's largest companies. Eventually it occurred to him that he had created far more 'situations' than Guy Debord ever did, and from there it was a short step to becoming a digital artist. Inspired by the US countercultural movement, and British cyberneticians of the 1960's, he spends increasing amounts of time using small pieces of wire to pick the locks of the doors of perception, and seeking (legal and non-pharmacological) 'technologies of the self'.</p>\n<p>His work has been exhibited or experienced at EVA London (2017), in the V&amp;A New Directions series (2017), at the 20th Generative Art Conference in Ravenna (2017), at the 4th World Congress of Psychogeography (2018 and 2019), and at Goldsmiths College (2018, 2019), where he is currently studying for an MA in Computational Art.</p>\n<p>He lives, solders, and is a flaneur in London.</p>\n","timestamp":"9/9/2020 15:34:08","email":"dupto001@gold.ac.uk","title":"Walking with  Data","wallTextInstructions":"n/a","videoDocUrl":null,"interactiveUrl":"https://www.codedwalls.com/walkingwithdata","streamTwitch":null,"streamYouTube":null,"themes":["Thing power","Bodies in relation","Distance orchestra"],"media":["interactive","data","generative"],"numImages":1,"found":true,"webInstructionsHTML":"<p>Using your smart phone, log on to www.codedwalls.com/walkingwithdata and follow the instructions there.</p>\n","artworkHTML":"<p>This work consists solely of the interactions between my website, your smartphone, and you. To experience it, log on with your smartphone to www.codedwalls.com/walkingwithdata , and follow the instructions.\nThe system was designed to accompany a psychogeographer on a walk. Because of COVID restriction this year, many such walks have been solitary, with only a virtual link between the walkers, and 'Walking With Data' is a system intended to provide an intelligent friend, that can re-contextualise and expand your experiences, and challenge your perceptions. Your smart phone will start to talk to you, and offer you access to data.\nIt downloads Javascript to your phone, which manages the interactions. It seeks data from the web using API requests, and interacts with others who are using the system at the same time.\nIt is intended to broaden our perceptionsespeically in areas where these are enigmatic, such a geomagnetism,  and also to build social interaction. It uses the Big Five personality scales to assess the likes and dislikes of users, and tries to understand them better.\nIt is very much a 'work in progress', and was first tested out at this year's 4th World Congress of Psychogeography.</p>\n","events":[]}
