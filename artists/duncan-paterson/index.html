This is (and will always be) work in progress.</p> <p>He’s exhibited in group shows including Fluid: London (Espacio Gallery, 2019), which transferred to Berlin (The Ballery, 2019); Romart Biennale (Rome, 2018), The Grid Art Fair, London (2018) Red Dot Art Fair, Miami (2016), and The Other Art Fair, London (2016); and was commissioned to make installations for The Secret Garden Party Festival (2016).</p> <p>Most recently, he’s been inspired, elevated and humbled by an ongoing collaboration with offworlder artist collective 0rphan Drift.</p> <p>His concerns right now are: what does it feel like to be a non-human thing? How can we decolonise and de-humanise art? Are computers magic? Can algorithms be spirits? He has lots of questions. Answers may or may not happen.</p> <p>What would he wish for if he died and was allowed to live again? He would ask to be a crow. Or an octopus.</p> <h3>Social links</h3> <div class=social-profile><span class=icon><i class="fa-instagram fab"></i></span> <a href=https://instagram.com/brother_sjur target=_blank>brother_sjur</a></div> </div></div></section></main></div> <script>__SAPPER__={baseUrl:"",preloaded:[void 0,null,(function(a){return {artist:{name:"Duncan Paterson",otherName:a,location:"London",website:a,youTube:a,vimeo:a,twitch:a,facebook:a,twitter:a,instagram:"brother_sjur",publicEmail:"dunc4npaterson@gmail.com",slug:"duncan-paterson",username:"dpate002",bioHTML:"\u003Cp\u003EA conceptual artist and creative director, Duncan Paterson aspires to be a multispecies storyteller and an anti-correlationist.
