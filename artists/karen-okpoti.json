The focus of the piece is the body in relation to the pole as these two distinct objects become one and the pole becomes a part of the extended self of the dancer. Certain possessions and external objects are seen to be a part of us and allow deeper explorations of the self. They extend our identity beyond the mind and body alone.</p>\n<p>This piece is created solely in Max Msp using the Kinect and Jitter for motion capture. Certain values are used as input to alter pitch, rhythm and to create melodies and unique compositions. The work aims to highlight the personal relationship the dancer has with the pole as this choice of object demystifies issues surrounding the female body and the male gaze. This is an art form with several connotations surrounding it and the aim of the piece is the exchange with the audience by capturing their attention and stealing their time but also allowing them to gaze at the movements of the enchanting woman. The soundscape created will vary for each iteration of the performance. Therefore, the different movements chosen will allow for the body to create the narrative, tonality and emotionality of the soundscape rather than the reverse.</p>\n","events":[{"startTime":"2020-09-20T16:00:00.000Z","duration":45,"livestream":true,"physical":null,"title":"Artist Q&A - Performative : Bodies in Relation","username":"ckarp001,kokpo001,elafk001","themes":"Bodies in Relation","medium":"Live Q&A with artists","desc":"An opportunity to watch demonstrations of our artist's work alongside in-depth insight into their process.
