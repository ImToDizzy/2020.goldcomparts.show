Her recent practice focuses on machine learning as a form of knowledge production. By using small, curated datasets, she studies the edges and logics of deep learning systems and reimagines them.</p> <p>Drawing from her background as feature writer, Veera’s work often looks into existing tech narratives and seeks to dissemble them. She holds a Master’s degree in Social Sciences from the University of Helsinki.</p> <p>Veera was one of the computational artists from Goldsmiths who was selected to work at a collaborative <em>In-grid</em> residency with Arebyte Gallery during summer 2020. Veera has exhibited her work as part of <em>Media Virality and the Lockdown Aesthetic</em> at Affect & Social Media 4.5 (2020), *Can Everybody See My Screen? * at Goldsmiths (2020) and <em>Push, Pop, Repeat</em> at Goldsmiths (2020). Her commissioned text <em>I Wonder if I Have Ever Even Felt Young</em> recently appeared in anthology <em>Wasted Years – Sad, Sexy and Artist-run</em> (2020) by gallery Sorbus.</p> <h3>Social links</h3> <div class=social-profile><span class=icon><i class="fab fa-instagram"></i></span> <a href=https://instagram.com/@veeraidaj target=_blank>@veeraidaj</a></div> <div class=social-profile><span class=icon><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></span> <a href="https://twitter.com/Maybe linkedin insted: https://www.linkedin.com/in/veerajussila/" target=_blank>Maybe linkedin insted: https://www.linkedin.com/in/veerajussila/</a></div> <div class=social-profile> <a href=https://www.veerajussila.com/ target=_blank>https://www.veerajussila.com/</a></div></div></div></section></main></div> <script>__SAPPER__={baseUrl:"",preloaded:[void 0,null,(function(a){return {artist:{name:"Veera Jussila",otherName:a,location:"London",website:"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.veerajussila.com\u002F",youTube:a,vimeo:a,twitch:a,facebook:a,twitter:"Maybe linkedin insted: https:\u002F\u002Fwww.linkedin.com\u002Fin\u002Fveerajussila\u002F",instagram:"@veeraidaj",publicEmail:"veera.i.jussila@gmail.com",slug:"veera-jussila",username:"vjuss001",bioHTML:"\u003Cp\u003EVeera Jussila\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EVeera Jussila is an artist and technologist whose work explores algorithmic decision-making and networks of communication.
