His artworks intend to explore and navigate a spectrum of dynamic resonance between organisms and machines based on the progression of his interdisciplinary research across biophysics, computation and art. He makes works in various media from painting, installations and performance, to digital and computational expressions.  His practice incorporates a consistant concern for &quot;fluid equilibrium&quot; and concept he conveyes though several media to create an extension of aesthetics: from the perception of visible things with natural organs to the perception of invisible things with the help of computation. His work simulates metaphysical reality to bring the meaning of art into more aspects of this current reality.</p>\n","events":[{"startTime":"2020-09-17T19:40:00.000Z","duration":6,"livestream":true,"physical":"yes","title":"All is a transient dream","username":"yzhan037","themes":"Thing Power, bodies in relation and multispecies rehearsal","medium":"Interactive Audiovisual Performance","desc":"This interactive performance intends to illustrate a dynamic relationship between organisms(performer) and machines(jellyfish) through a series of visual effects, improvised dancing and tailored soundtrack."},{"startTime":"2020-09-18T18:50:00.000Z","duration":6,"livestream":false,"physical":"yes","title":"All is a transient dream","username":"yzhan037","themes":"Thing Power, bodies in relation and multispecies rehearsal","medium":"Interactive Audiovisual Performance","desc":"This interactive performance intends to illustrate a dynamic relationship between organisms(performer) and machines(jellyfish) through a series of visual effects, improvised dancing and tailored soundtrack."},{"startTime":"2020-09-19T13:40:00.000Z","duration":6,"livestream":false,"physical":"yes","title":"All is a transient dream","username":"yzhan037","themes":"Thing Power, bodies in relation and multispecies rehearsal","medium":"Interactive Audiovisual Performance","desc":"This interactive performance intends to illustrate a dynamic relationship between organisms(performer) and machines(jellyfish) through a series of visual effects, improvised dancing and tailored soundtrack."},{"startTime":"2020-09-19T19:30:00.000Z","duration":6,"livestream":false,"physical":"yes","title":"All is a transient dream","username":"yzhan037","themes":"Thing Power, bodies in relation and multispecies rehearsal","medium":"Interactive Audiovisual Performance","desc":"This interactive performance intends to illustrate a dynamic relationship between organisms(performer) and machines(jellyfish) through a series of visual effects, improvised dancing and tailored soundtrack."},{"startTime":"2020-09-20T11:50:00.000Z","duration":6,"livestream":false,"physical":"yes","title":"All is a transient dream","username":"yzhan037","themes":"Thing Power, bodies in relation and multispecies rehearsal","medium":"Interactive Audiovisual Performance","desc":"This interactive performance intends to illustrate a dynamic relationship between organisms(performer) and machines(jellyfish) through a series of visual effects, improvised dancing and tailored soundtrack."},{"startTime":"2020-09-18T13:30:00.000Z","duration":45,"livestream":true,"physical":null,"title":"Spotlight Panel: Can plants and animals make art?","username":"floft001, ylu007, yjun001, yzhan037","themes":"Multispecies Rehearsal, Paracomputing","medium":"Spotlight Panel","desc":"This panel is a chance to learn more about our artist's making work which explores multispecies artmaking and whether plants and animals can be their own artists, performers and musicians."}]}
