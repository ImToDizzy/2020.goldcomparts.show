I’d rather address you like a person, than in the 3rd person. I worked for many years as an interactive designer in the USA, UK, and Mexico. I quit. I’ve also done random things like working on a goat farm, which is far better than being an interactive designer. I used to create illustrations, I’ve had a few photography shows, and I like to write. I’m working on an MFA at Goldsmiths to bring all of this together into a unified digital arts practice.</p>\n","events":[{"startTime":"2020-09-17T17:15:00.000Z","duration":45,"livestream":true,"physical":null,"title":"Spotlight Panel: How do we fight for our rights during a global pandemic?","username":"ktind001, jgoul002, jlawt001","themes":"Computational Resistance,Distance Orchestra","medium":"Spotlight Panel","desc":"This panel is a chance to learn more about our artist's making work which explores living during a global pandemic as well as resistance with the Black Lives Matter and Climate Crisis movements during 2020.","id":4},{"startTime":"2020-09-20T11:30:00.000Z","duration":45,"livestream":true,"physical":null,"title":"Artist Q&A - Computational Resistance","username":"gmont004,jlawt001,amiro001","themes":"Computational Resistance","medium":"Live Q&A with artists","desc":"An opportunity to watch demonstrations of our artist's work alongside in-depth insight into their process.
