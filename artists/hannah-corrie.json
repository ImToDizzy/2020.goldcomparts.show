Hannah sees the city as a constantly evolving source of inspiration - a heaving, breathing mass of individuals, industry and intersecting\nbeliefs.</p>\n<p>A background in psychology and neuroscience encouraged a practice of research, hypothesis, experimentation, testing and evaluation. Whilst still firmly rooted in this field Hannah worked as a theorist in an artistic residency withThe Koppel Project (2015) exploring the theme of utopia.
