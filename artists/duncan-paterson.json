This is (and will always be) work in progress.</p>\n<p>He’s exhibited in group shows including Fluid: London (Espacio Gallery, 2019), which transferred to Berlin (The Ballery, 2019), The Grid Art Fair, London (2018), E17 Art Trail (London, 2017 &amp; 2019), Spectrum (Miami, 2016), and The Other Art Fair, London (2016); and was commissioned to make installations for The Secret Garden Party Festival (2016).</p>\n<p>Most recently, he’s been inspired, elevated and humbled by an ongoing collaboration with offworlder artist collective 0rphan Drift.</p>\n<p>His concerns right now are: what does it feel like to be a non-human thing? How can we decolonise and de-humanise art? Are computers magic? Can algorithms be spirits? He has lots of questions. Answers may or may not happen.</p>\n<p>What would he wish for if he died and was allowed to live again? He would ask to be a crow. Or an octopus.</p>\n","events":[{"startTime":"2020-09-18T14:15:00.000Z","duration":60,"livestream":true,"physical":null,"title":"Discussion Panel: Is the artist a creator or curator?","username":"dpate002, hryan003, nadam001, kclyn001","themes":"Thing Power, Multispecies Rehearsal, Paracomputing","medium":"Discussion Panel","desc":"This panel is a chance to hear a student lead discussion around what it means to make art even when the art can make itself."}]}
