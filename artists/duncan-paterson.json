This is (and will always be) work in progress.</p>\n<p>He’s exhibited in group shows including Fluid: London (Espacio Gallery, 2019), which transferred to Berlin (The Ballery, 2019); Romart Biennale (Rome, 2018), The Grid Art Fair, London (2018) Red Dot Art Fair, Miami (2016), and The Other Art Fair, London (2016); and was commissioned to make installations for The Secret Garden Party Festival (2016).</p>\n<p>Most recently, he’s been inspired, elevated and humbled by an ongoing collaboration with offworlder artist collective 0rphan Drift.</p>\n<p>His concerns right now are: what does it feel like to be a non-human thing? How can we decolonise and de-humanise art? Are computers magic? Can algorithms be spirits? He has lots of questions. Answers may or may not happen.</p>\n<p>What would he wish for if he died and was allowed to live again? He would ask to be a crow. Or an octopus.</p>\n<p>Insta: @brother_Sjur</p>\n<p>[ends]</p>\n"}
