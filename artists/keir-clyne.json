Through the reformatting of dance and choreographic practises, Keir uses non-human and group participation within the process of creating work to unbalance the hierarchical structure of power within traditional dance practises.</p>\n<p>Their work also draws inspiration from both academia, such as non-humanism studies and queer theory, as well as pop culture such as video gaming culture and early web aesthetics.</p>\n<p>Graduating from a BA(Hons) in Dance &amp; Choreography at Falmouth University (2018) Keir then attended an MA in Fine Art at Wimbledon College of Arts (2019).
