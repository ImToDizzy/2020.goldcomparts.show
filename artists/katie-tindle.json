Tindle's work prompts these questions in a critical, but darkly funny and complicated way.</p>\n","events":[{"startTime":"2020-09-17T17:15:00.000Z","duration":45,"livestream":true,"physical":false,"title":"Spotlight Panel: How do we fight for our rights during a global pandemic?","username":"ktind001, jgoul002, jlawt001","themes":"Computational Resistance,Distance Orchestra","medium":"Spotlight Panel","desc":"This panel is a chance to learn more about our artist's making work which explores living during a global pandemic as well as resistance with the Black Lives Matter and Climate Crisis movements during 2020.","id":4},{"startTime":"2020-09-20T14:15:00.000Z","duration":45,"livestream":true,"physical":false,"title":"Artist Q&A - Distance Orchestra","username":"khill003,cdeba001,ktind001","themes":"Distance Orchestra","medium":"Live Q&A with artists","desc":"An opportunity to watch demonstrations of our artist's work alongside in-depth insight into their process.
