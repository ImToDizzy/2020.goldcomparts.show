It is core to Eleanor's practice to project an increasingly inclusive art world in contrast to her early artistic experiences. As she continues to explore this relationship she intends to work across a variety of media and method by ultimately combining computation and outcome, her long-term goal is to redefine what it means to be a maze designer.</p>\n<p>Eleanor is currently a Junior Developer at The Mill (London) where she works primarily within Augmented Reality.</p>\n","events":[]}
