Her recent practice focuses on machine learning as a form of knowledge production. By using small, curated datasets, she studies the edges and logics of deep learning systems and reimagines them.</p>\n<p>Drawing from her background as feature writer, Veera’s work often looks into existing tech narratives and seeks to dissemble them. She holds a Master’s degree in Social Sciences from the University of Helsinki.</p>\n<p>Veera was one of the computational artists from Goldsmiths who was selected to work at a collaborative <em>In-grid</em> residency with Arebyte Gallery during summer 2020.
