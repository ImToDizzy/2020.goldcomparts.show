By remaking useless daily objects to reproduce outdated machines (a record player and a film projector) and make them interact with the audience, it is intended to create an immersive experience through physical computing and max/MSP to explore the relationship between human and machine, as well as the boundary between low-tech and high-tech objects. Today, when goods are becoming more and more mass-produced and virtualized, manpower input and the time spend on daily objects are decreasing at the same time, making people feel more alienated from physical objects. In this piece, communication and changes only happen when the viewerâ€™s body interacts with the objects. It also presents a sense of emptiness under a colourful and psychedelic high-tech-world. If the progress of technology will only make people lose themselves even more, then in this useless future, what kind of human will we become?</p>\n","events":[{"startTime":"2020-09-18T16:15:00.000Z","duration":45,"livestream":true,"physical":null,"title":"Artist Q&A - Bodies in Relation","username":"jquin002, pchen006, mli006","themes":"Bodies in Relation","medium":"Live Q&A with artists","desc":"An opportunity to watch demonstrations of our artist's work alongside in-depth insight into their process.
