Her work is situated at the intersection of dance and technology.</p>\n<p>She creates work for galleries, the stage, and more unconventional sites, in the form of interactive installations, audio-visual experiences and performances. Her background in engineering and interaction design, combined with her experience as a performer and choreographer gives her a unique perspective when working with dance and technology.</p>\n<p>Her recent work focuses on exploring notions of control, harassment and apathy, questioning how human behaviours are changed when using technology as a proxy to interact with each other. In light of the recent events, her work is evolving into researching collaboration, communal experience and liveness in online performances.</p>\n<p>In 2012, she created l'Atelier du Lampadaire, a multi-disciplinary artistic collective, based in France. It involved dancers, actors, software engineers, architects and designers. Its aim was to create interactive performances at the intersection of those disciplines.</p>\n<p>In 2019, she presented her work in several group exhibitions, including <em>Anamorphic Waves</em> at Ugly Duck, Kallida festival and the <em>London Ultra</em> at the Oxo Tower.</p>\n<p>Since the beginning of 2020, she is part of a research project between Goldsmiths University in London, the University of Lasalle in Singapore and Mavin Khoo, Creative Associate of Akram Khan Dance Company. The project aims at exploring how camera-less motion capture technology can enable virtual collaboration between dancers in remote locations.</p>\n<p>Clemence has an MSc in Mechanical Engineering and Industrial Design (2009) from the University of Technology of Compi√®gne (France). She quickly specialised in User Experience and Interaction Design and has since worked on many high profile projects including <em>Decathlon</em>, <em>the Metropolitan Police</em>, <em>TfL</em> and <em>MTA</em> (NYC). In parallel to her academic studies, she trained as a dancer, focusing particularly on contemporary and dance theatre techniques.</p>\n","events":[{"startTime":"2020-09-17T20:00:00.000Z","duration":15,"livestream":true,"physical":"yes","title":"Results May Vary","username":"cdeba001","themes":"Distance orchestra, Experiential Array, Memory Bank","medium":"Live, Performance, Playable experience","desc":"An interactive performance influenced in real-time by the audience's recollections of the lockdown.
