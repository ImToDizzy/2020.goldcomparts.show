It is core to Eleanor’s practice to project an increasingly inclusive art world in contrast to her early artistic experiences. As she continues to explore this relationship she intends to work across a variety of media and method by ultimately combining computation and outcome, her long-term goal is to redefine what it means to be a maze designer.</p> <p>Eleanor is currently a Junior Developer at The Mill (London) where she works primarily within Augmented Reality.</p> <h3>Social links</h3> <div class=social-profile><span class=icon><i class="fa-external-link-alt fas"></i></span> <a href=https://www.eleanoredwards.co.uk/ target=_blank>https://www.eleanoredwards.co.uk/</a></div> <div class=social-profile><span class=icon><i class="fa-instagram fab"></i></span> <a href=https://instagram.com/orangedinosaurdisco target=_blank>orangedinosaurdisco</a></div> </div></div></section></main></div> <script>__SAPPER__={baseUrl:"",preloaded:[void 0,null,(function(a){return {artist:{name:"Eleanor Edwards",otherName:a,location:"London",website:"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.eleanoredwards.co.uk\u002F",youTube:a,vimeo:"eleanoredwards",twitch:a,facebook:a,twitter:a,instagram:"orangedinosaurdisco",publicEmail:"orangedinosaurdisco@gmail.com",slug:"eleanor-edwards",username:"eedwa001",bioHTML:"\u003Cp\u003EEleanor Edwards is an artist whose current practice explores ‘the experience’ through computational mediums.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EEleanor’s interest in computation evolved during 2016 when she began to expand her largely computer based visual art and design practice through the mediums of projection mapping and visual scripting. \u003Cem\u003EDigital Illusions\u003C\u002Fem\u003E (2016) was her first interactive piece that gave significance to the audience within the art object.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMigrating the audience from passive to active through the addition of computation emphasises the symbiotic relationship between artist, art object and audience.
