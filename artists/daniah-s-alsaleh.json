By deconstructing and rearranging familiar\nobjects and ideas, she makes the invisible visible, manifesting a space for reflection that prompts new\nperspectives and ways of seeing. Systems shape both subject and methodology, as she maps networks\nand structures from language and social orders. Crossing disciplines, her explorations include traditional\nmediums of painting  combined with generative  computational processes .</p>\n"}
