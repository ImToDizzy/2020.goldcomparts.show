Alsaleh tackles notions\nof the unobtrusive, the ordinary, and the common. By deconstructing and rearranging familiar\nobjects and ideas, she makes the invisible visible, manifesting a space for reflection that prompts new\nperspectives and ways of seeing. Systems shape both subject and methodology, as she maps networks\nand structures from language and social orders. Crossing disciplines, her explorations include traditional\nmediums of painting  combined with generative computational processes.</p>\n","events":[{"startTime":"2020-09-18T11:30:00.000Z","duration":45,"livestream":true,"physical":null,"title":"Artist Q&A - Thing Powers","username":"dliu001, dalsa002, belda001","themes":"Thing Power","medium":"Live Q&A with artists","desc":"An opportunity to watch demonstrations of our artist's work alongside in-depth insight into their process.
