He often works collaboratively, operating from within a shared pool of experience, collectively facilitating new means of sharing and interaction. He aims to produce scenarios that encourage intra-action and feedback, which help to develop new relations between art and its audiences.</p>\n<p>He is currently researching new ways of rendering 3D images and creating musical instruments in AR, looking at these processes as ways of imagining new worlds with new modes of being. He has reapproached and conceptualised the making process, examining how we compress, simulate and render an infinite world through finite resources. How do we cut corners and what does this tell us about how we see and treat the world? How can we use our current resources to see from a different advantage point, to imagine what's over another horizon?</p>\n","timestamp":"9/5/2020 18:20:37","email":"gsimm002@gold.ac.uk","title":"Cosmic Mourn","videoDocUrl":null,"interactiveUrl":null,"streamTwitch":null,"streamYouTube":null,"themes":["Thing power","Bodies in relation","Experiential array"],"media":["audio visual","AR","3D"],"numImages":1,"found":true,"webInstructionsHTML":"<p>To try it out, Dowload it on an AR ready device from these links :( Links to come, hope thats ok)</p>\n","artworkHTML":"<p>Cosmic Mourn is an AR soundscape installation using procedural instruments, built in Unity.
