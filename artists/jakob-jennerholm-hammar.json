The translation and communication between\ndifferent media and technologies is central within his practice. Processes of\ntransformation and change are explored in a multitude of ways, as in the\npassing of digital data and generative designs to broken analogue machinery,\nbodily movements to computational systems or the transfer of synthesized\nelectronic signals to screens, paper and textiles. The materials and\ntechnological familiars conjured are encouraged to leave their marks as\ncollaborators, co-creating in never ending feedback loops and conversations.\nA background in live visuals and interactive art initiated an experimental\napproach to technology and artistic explorations. Inquiries always made\nalongside questions of fate, agency and responsibility.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/knoegle/\">Instagram</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.jennerholmhammar.info\">Website</a></p>\n"}
