The translation and communication between different media and technologies is central within his practice. Processes of transformation and change are explored in a multitude of ways, as in the passing of digital data and generative designs to broken analogue machinery, bodily movements to computational systems or the transfer of synthesized electronic signals to screens, paper and textiles. The materials and technological familiars conjured are encouraged to leave their marks as collaborators, co-creating in never ending feedback loops and conversations. A background in live visuals and interactive art initiated an experimental approach to technology and artistic explorations. Inquiries always made alongside questions of fate, agency and responsibility.</p>\n"}
