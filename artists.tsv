<p>Callum Fowler works at the intersection between technology, generative art, and music. His work explores topics surrounding human-computer interactions and relationships. These themes tend to appear to humanise technology or to create novel experiences using technology.</p>
<p>Having a background in audio technology and composition, Callum specialises in audio-visual installations and performances. Over the past year he has also expanded into visual/interactive/web art. Notable works include: [<em>My Ecology</em>] (https://callumfowler101.github.io/portfolio.html#my_ecology), [<em>The Happy Computer</em>] (https://callumfowler101.github.io/portfolio.html#happy_computer), [<em>Human and Computer</em>] (https://callumfowler101.github.io/portfolio.html#human_computer).</p>
<p>Callum is also interested in building software for artists to use. Currently he is working on [<em>Orbs</em>] (https://callumfowler101.github.io/portfolio.html#orbs), a midi visualiser that can be used with digital midi devices. He has also built other mini applications for generative design.</p>

Her work is situated at the intersection of dance and technology.</p>
<p>She creates work for galleries, the stage, and more unconventional sites, in the form of interactive installations, audio-visual experiences and performances. Her background in engineering and interaction design, combined with her experience as a performer and choreographer gives her a unique perspective when working with dance and technology.</p>
<p>Her recent work focuses on exploring notions of control, harassment and apathy, questioning how human behaviours are changed when using technology as a proxy to interact with each other.  In light of the recent events, her work is evolving into researching collaboration, communal experience and liveness in online performances.</p>
<p>In 2012, she created l'Atelier du Lampadaire, a multi-disciplinary artistic collective, based in France. It involved dancers, actors, software engineers, architects and designers. Its aim was to create interactive performances at the intersection of those disciplines.</p>
<p>In 2019, she presented her work in several  group exhibitions, including Anamorphic Waves at Ugly Duck, Kallida festival and the London Ultra at the Oxo Tower.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of 2020, she is part of a research project between Goldsmiths University in London, the university of Lasalle in Singapore and Mavin Khoo, Creative Associate of Akram Khan Dance Company. The project aims at exploring how camera-less motion capture technology can enable virtual collaboration between dancers in remote locations.</p>
<p>Clemence has an MSc in Mechanical Engineering and Industrial Design (2009) from the University of Technology of Compiègne (France).  She quickly specialised in User Experience and Interaction Design and, since, worked on many high profile projects including Decathlon, the Metropolitan Police, TfL and MTA (NYC). In parallel to her academic studies, she trained as a dancer, focusing particularly on contemporary and dance theatre techniques.</p>

He embraces the digital world because it offers him such a range of new opportunities.</p>
<p>After starting his career in the UK Foreign Office, he built up, with some friends, a small, specialised, management consultancy company, which organised crisis simulation exercises all over the world, for several of the world's largest companies. Eventually it occurred to him that he had created far more 'situations' than Guy Debord ever did, and from there it was a short step to becoming a digital artist. Inspired by the US countercultural movement, and British cyberneticians of the 1960's, he spends increasing amounts of time using small pieces of wire to pick the locks of the doors of perception, and seeking (legal and non-pharmacological) 'technologies of the self'.</p>
<p>His work has been exhibited or experienced at EVA London (2017), in the V&amp;A New Directions series (2017), at the 20th Generative Art Conference in Ravenna (2017), at the 4th World Congress of Psychogeography (2018 and 2019), and at Goldsmiths College (2018, 2019, 2020), where he is currently studying for an MA in Computational Art.</p>

<p>Most recently, he’s been inspired, elevated and humbled by an ongoing collaboration with offworlder artist collective 0rphan Drift.</p>

<p>Eleanor’s interest in computation evolved during 2016 when she began to expand her largely computer based visual art and design practice through the mediums of projection mapping and visual scripting. <em>Digital Illusions</em> (2016) was her first interactive piece that gave significance to the audience within the art object.</p>
<p>Migrating the audience from passive to active through the addition of computation emphasises the symbiotic relationship between artist, art object and audience. It is core to Eleanor’s practice to project an increasingly inclusive art world in contrast to her early artistic experiences. As she continues to explore this relationship she intends to work across a variety of media and method by ultimately combining computation and outcome, her long-term goal is to redefine what it means to be a maze designer.</p>

His work is developed collaboratively using improvisation.</p>
<p>His early community-based theater pieces were generated and performed by LGBT homeless youth, guided by a team of theater professionals under the name, <em>“Fringe Benefits”</em>. As a solo performance artist, Ernie appropriated and deconstructed Hollywood narratives of rugged masculinity.</p>
<p>Ernie’s recent work continues to resist the dominant paradigms of American culture. He explores explicitly political content such as racism or noise pollution as well as more abstract themes such as human/machine collaboration and the illusion of self. In addition to live performance, Ernie creates generative art, prints, and video.</p>

He is currently researching new ways of rendering 3D images and creating musical instruments in AR, looking at these processes as ways of imagining new worlds with new modes of being. He has reapproached and conceptualised the making process, examining how we compress, simulate and render an infinite world through finite resources. How do we cut corners and what does this tell us about how we see and treat the world? How can we use our current resources to see from a different advantage point, to imagine what's over another horizon?</p>

<p>Jakob Jennerholm Hammar is an audio visual artist working within an ever
expanding area of interests. The translation and communication between
different media and technologies is central within his practice. Processes of
transformation and change are explored in a multitude of ways, as in the
passing of digital data and generative designs to broken analogue machinery,
bodily movements to computational systems or the transfer of synthesized
electronic signals to screens, paper and textiles. The materials and
technological familiars conjured are encouraged to leave their marks as
collaborators, co-creating in never ending feedback loops and conversations.
A background in live visuals and interactive art initiated an experimental
approach to technology and artistic explorations. Inquiries always made
alongside questions of fate, agency and responsibility.</p>

His artworks intend to explore and navigate a spectrum of dynamic resonance between organisms and machines based on the progression of his interdisciplinary research across biophysics, computation, and art. The media of his works vary from painting, installations, performance, to digital and computational expressions.  An overarching concept, &quot;fluid equilibrium,&quot; is conveyed by his practices with incorporated media to create an extension of aesthetics: from the perception of visible things with natural organs to the perception of invisible things with the help of computation. He simulates metaphysical reality to bring the meaning of art into more aspects of this current reality. He is currently pursuing the MFA Computational Arts program at Goldsmiths, University of London.</p>
