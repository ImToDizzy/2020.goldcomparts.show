Her work is situated at the intersection of dance and technology.</p>
<p>She creates work for galleries, the stage, and more unconventional sites, in the form of interactive installations, audio-visual experiences and performances. Her background in engineering and interaction design, combined with her experience as a performer and choreographer gives her a unique perspective when working with dance and technology.</p>
<p>Her recent work focuses on exploring notions of control, harassment and apathy, questioning how human behaviours are changed when using technology as a proxy to interact with each other.  In light of the recent events, her work is evolving into researching collaboration, communal experience and liveness in online performances.</p>
<p>In 2012, she created l'Atelier du Lampadaire, a multi-disciplinary artistic collective, based in France. It involved dancers, actors, software engineers, architects and designers. Its aim was to create interactive performances at the intersection of those disciplines.</p>
<p>In 2019, she presented her work in several  group exhibitions, including Anamorphic Waves at Ugly Duck, Kallida festival and the London Ultra at the Oxo Tower.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of 2020, she is part of a research project between Goldsmiths University in London, the university of Lasalle in Singapore and Mavin Khoo, Creative Associate of Akram Khan Dance Company. The project aims at exploring how camera-less motion capture technology can enable virtual collaboration between dancers in remote locations.</p>
<p>Clemence has an MSc in Mechanical Engineering and Industrial Design (2009) from the University of Technology of Compiègne (France).  She quickly specialised in User Experience and Interaction Design and, since, worked on many high profile projects including Decathlon, the Metropolitan Police, TfL and MTA (NYC). In parallel to her academic studies, she trained as a dancer, focusing particularly on contemporary and dance theatre techniques.</p>

<p>Most recently, he’s been inspired, elevated and humbled by an ongoing collaboration with offworlder artist collective 0rphan Drift.</p>
<p>His concerns right now are: what does it feel like to be a non-human thing? How can we decolonise and de-humanise art? Are computers magic? Can algorithms be spirits? He has lots of questions. Answers may or may not happen.</p>

<p>Eleanor’s interest in computation evolved during 2016 when she began to expand her largely computer based visual art and design practice through the mediums of projection mapping and visual scripting. <em>Digital Illusions</em> (2016) was her first interactive piece that gave significance to the audience within the art object.</p>
<p>Migrating the audience from passive to active through the addition of computation emphasises the symbiotic relationship between artist, art object and audience. It is core to Eleanor’s practice to project an increasingly inclusive art world in contrast to her early artistic experiences. As she continues to explore this relationship she intends to work across a variety of media and method by ultimately combining computation and outcome, her long-term goal is to redefine what it means to be a maze designer.</p>

He often works collaboratively, operating from within a shared pool of experience, collectively facilitating new means of sharing and interaction. He aims to produce scenarios that encourage intra-action and feedback, which help to develop new relations between art and its audiences.
He is currently researching new ways of rendering 3D images and creating musical instruments in AR, looking at these processes as ways of imagining new worlds with new modes of being. He has reapproached and conceptualised the making process, examining how we compress, simulate and render an infinite world through finite resources. How do we cut corners and what does this tell us about how we see and treat the world? How can we use our current resources to see from a different advantage point, to imagine what's over another horizon?</p>

<p>Jakob Jennerholm Hammar is an audio visual artist working within an ever
expanding area of interests. The translation and communication between
different media and technologies is central within his practice. Processes of
transformation and change are explored in a multitude of ways, as in the
passing of digital data and generative designs to broken analogue machinery,
bodily movements to computational systems or the transfer of synthesized
electronic signals to screens, paper and textiles. The materials and
technological familiars conjured are encouraged to leave their marks as
collaborators, co-creating in never ending feedback loops and conversations.
A background in live visuals and interactive art initiated an experimental
approach to technology and artistic explorations. Inquiries always made
alongside questions of fate, agency and responsibility.</p>

<p>Drawing from her background as feature writer, Veera’s work often looks into existing tech narratives and seeks to dissemble them. She holds a Master’s degree in Social Sciences from the University of Helsinki.</p>
<p>Veera was one of the computational artists from Goldsmiths who was selected to work at a collaborative <em>In-grid</em> residency with Arebyte Gallery during summer 2020. Veera has exhibited her work as part of <em>Media Virality and the Lockdown Aesthetic</em> at Affect &amp; Social Media 4.5 (2020), *Can Everybody See My Screen? * at Goldsmiths (2020) and <em>Push, Pop, Repeat</em> at Goldsmiths (2020).

Wesley Talbot		London		https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC56OdcOaa_rzWixpHj4leqQ?view_as=subscriber							wesley-talbot	wtalb001	"<p>I am interested in our relationship to digital imagery: how we disseminate information, co-opt meaning and respond to its omnipresence. Our familiarity with the digital image and the concept of its infinite malleability are central to my work. By manipulating, re-contextualizing, and sharing we engage the image directly and offer alternate meanings.</p>
<p>My studio practice has led me to experiment with multiple mediums and techniques and having now studied Computational Arts I am better equipped to express these ideas. I am currently investigating robotics and AI art to continue my work in the digital space adding questions of agency.</p>

Her artworks focus on the relationship between time dimension and experience, media and memory. She believes that individual experience and memory are sincere testimony of the existence of the world. For creators, whether it is personal or group memory, what is important is not only the things experience that can be traced back through the media, but also the process of how the memory is constructed and the ways of seeing.</p>

His artworks intend to explore and navigate a spectrum of dynamic resonance between organisms and machines based on the progression of his interdisciplinary research across biophysics, computation, and art. The media of his works vary from painting, installations, performance, to digital and computational expressions.  An overarching concept, &quot;fluid equilibrium,&quot; is conveyed by his practices with incorporated media to create an extension of aesthetics: from the perception of visible things with natural organs to the perception of invisible things with the help of computation. He simulates metaphysical reality to bring the meaning of art into more aspects of this current reality. He is currently pursuing the MFA Computational Arts program at Goldsmiths, University of London.</p>
