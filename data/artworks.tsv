The conversation is about the evolution of different spices. As a result, jellyfish is considered to be a pinnacle of the evolutionary process because they proceed strictly on the basis of ‘observation, logic and the scientific method’. Their 96 percent water entities mock at the omnipresent aggrandisement of human beings as the essence of all creatures. Jellyfish are bio-machines, emotional AI and a multi-layered interconnected conscious web.
With the help of computation, ‘All is a transient dream’ simulates a temporal-spatial dialogue  between ‘gorilla’ and ‘jellyfish’, physical and virtual, organisms and machines, hence in this project, performers and an interactive system that materialises itself through the imitation of jellyfish as well as the dancing motion of the performers. This interactive performance intends to illustrate a dynamic relationship between organisms and machines through a series of visual effects, improvised dancing and tailored soundtrack."

The text of these dreams were tokenised into words and phrases, then fed into a vectorisation algorithm, using one hundred dimensions. These vectors were then projected into 3D space, and from there a map to dreamspace was possible.

The work explores the patterns and coincidences of our dreams and invites us to questions the Jungian ideas of collective unconscious. Are we dreaming the same dreams? 

The projection situates us within a gentle orbit of _Dreamspace_, rotating around a central brain. Each star representing a term or phrase curated from the vast cosmos of ideas, symbols and archetypes which make up the space.

The maps are a cartographic representation of the space, where each dream can be traced as a constellation connecting the stars which feature in the dream. They use a stereographic projection of both hemispheres with an axial a tilt of 51.5 degrees (the latitude of Goldsmiths). 

The labels around the dials use the months of French Revolutionary Calendar, alluding to ideas of [24/7 Late Capitalism and the Ends of Sleep](https://www.versobooks.com/books/1570-24-7) by _Jonathan Crary_ that sleep is an inherently anti-capitalist activity, where we neither create value nor are bounded by our material wealth.

Technical details:
Dream texts were scraped and tokenised using JavaScript. Word2Vec was used to create the vector space which was then used T-SNE with TensorFlow for dimension reduction. The 3D space was built using Three JS, the map projections using D3 and the prints were created using custom JavaScript to create HPGL for a Roland DPX-3300 plotter."

It explores using ellements of play and exploration as a means to overcome the technicalities and complexities of standard music making, whilst also allowing the persons embodyment in the virtual space to play a larg role in the veiwing/playing of the peice. 

The audio in the peice was a collaboration with Izzy Nahkla and is a recording of improvised singing. In the peice it produces a beautiful choral of voices building and fading, guided by your interaction."
