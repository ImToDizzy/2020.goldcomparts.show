**Any movement** in front of the printing system initiates the printing process. The emergent backend system feeds into the drafts and the “threading” of virtual warp threads. **Horizontal movements** navigate the “treadling”, selecting which warp threads to be lifted. **Vertical movements**, as in raising one's arms, changes in what way the digital loom will be set up and updated while no motion is detected. Over time, motions seen by the computer in the room influences the environment and behaviours of the emergent system as well as the tieUp of the weaving draft.
