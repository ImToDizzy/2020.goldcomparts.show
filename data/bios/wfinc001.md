Williams Fincannon is an artist/illustrator experimenting with new
approaches to creating 2D animations and illustrations. Having a
background in music performance, his creations are heavily inspired by
music and are primarily intended to be experienced in a live performance
setting. His style draws on his formal studies in graphic design, and is
influenced by the mid 1900â€™s animated films that pervaded his childhood.
The subject matter of his work typically deals with identity
impermanence and reconciling the analog with the digital.
