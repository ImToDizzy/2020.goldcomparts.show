Visual designer, work design human and anything related to human

I hope to use the experience and experience in visual design to show the relationship between humans and the environment through kinect interaction.

In my past creations, I have used installations, videos, photography and other art forms to express the relationship between humans and other things. For example, city, time, symbol, etc. In this work, I want to show the relationship between human beings and the environment, not only in society and cities, but also in the universe and nature.
