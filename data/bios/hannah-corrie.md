Hannah Corrie is an experimental storyteller whose work investigates non-places, temporal irregularity and the powers that govern them. Hannah sees the city as a constantly evolving source of inspiration - a heaving, breathing mass of individuals, industry and intersecting 
beliefs. 

A background in psychology and neuroscience encouraged a practice of research, hypothesis, experimentation, testing and evaluation. Whilst still firmly rooted in this field Hannah worked as a theorist in an artistic residency withThe Koppel Project (2015) exploring the theme of utopia. Following this residency Hannah decided to develop and adapt these scientific methodologies into an artistic practice.
