Karen Okpoti is a computational and performance artist, who experiments with body tracking technologies to explore fluidity and motion of the human body as a medium to create interactive soundscapes.

Karen's work also considers how virtual environments can be used to create digital metaverses, as a way to enhance the digital self and discover how humans interact within 3D spaces. Previous shows Karen has participated in include the *Can you see my screen?* (2020) digital exhibition, with the piece *Sounds of the Golden Coast*, a project which pays homage to her homeland of Ghana through an interactive musical instrument.

In future, Karen aims to continue her work in this direction, bringing to life compelling narratives through interactive soundscapes and motion.
