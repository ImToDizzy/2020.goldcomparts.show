James Quinn is an actor, writer, and computational storyteller whose practise employs performance and interactive fiction to create narrative space for his audience to consider the moment’s meaningful questions.

Today’s rapidly changing culture, catalysed by technological growth, presents unfamiliar terrain to navigate. The artist has responded by drawing on his theatrical background and newly acquired coding skill to create dark and often funny narrative experiences at the intersection of computation and story.

“Fiction has always helped us understand our environment”, he has said. “There’s much to make sense of right now, and computation is at the forefront of it”.

James was born within the sound of Bow Bells but now hears the squawk of seagulls in Brighton where we lives with his partner.
