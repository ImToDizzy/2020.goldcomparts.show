Hazel Ryan draws from a cross-disciplinary background spanning mathematics, music and humanities towards her distributed and open creative practice.

Her current focus is on the medium of playable experience, mining the space between game and speculative simulation which is rich with possibilities of democratised access. With this approach she examines questions around digital lives under capitalism.

As a musician involved in the Algorave live coding movement, she has performed at venues such as Cafe OTO and Corsica Studios, and in her nascent visual practice she has exhibited in group shows including at the Horniman Museum.

Hazel's practice is supported by her professional experience in London arts institutions.
