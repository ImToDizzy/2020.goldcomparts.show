Jonny Fuller-Rowell is a site-specific installation artist, exploring the intersections between computation, live performance and interactivity. His work explores human-technology relations by isolating and amplifying sounds and visuals, focusing on issues of presence and participation. The installations investigate ways that our relationship to objects, space and time can shape our perceptual experience of �being in the world�. Since completing his Masters in Fine Art at Birmingham Institute of Art and Design in 2002 Jonny has worked on numerous international exhibitions including SCREEN Moving Image Festival, Barcelona (2017), The Biennial for Emerging Arts, Romania (2017) and The Starmach Gallery, Krakow (2016).
