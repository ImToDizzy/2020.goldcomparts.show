Giulia Monterrosa is a user experience researcher and artist, whose practice interrogates the socio-cultural meanings of the information society. 
Drawing on her background in UX design, Giulia critically engages with ubiquitous interfaces and computational systems and aims to challenge and stimulate new ways of understanding contemporary surveillance structures. Her research is translated into visual and narrative form through the use of technology and design. 
Recent work has looked at self-tracking practices and how these influence the perception of the self as well as social dynamics.
