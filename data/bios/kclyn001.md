��Keir Clyne is a virtual choreographer whose work uses lightweight software to create choreographic explorations more akin to games than dances. Through the reformatting of dance and choreographic practises, Keir uses non-human and group participation within the process of creating work to unbalance the hierarchical structure of power within traditional dance practises.

  Their work also draws inspiration from both academia, such as non-humanism studies and queer theory, as well as pop culture such as video gaming culture and early web aesthetics.

  Graduating from a BA(Hons) in Dance & Choreography at Falmouth University (2018) Keir then attended an MA in Fine Art at Wimbledon College of Arts (2019). Since then Keir has shown work in group shows such as *Postopia* with the Uncovered Collective (2019) as well as participated in residences such as the Digital Artist's Residency (2020).
