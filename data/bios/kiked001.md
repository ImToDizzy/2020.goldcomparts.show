Keita Ikeda is a creative technologist working with light, physical materials and computer programming to explore visual perception, form and materiality.

They seek to design alternative mediums of artistic expression, and find beauty not only in the content of a work, but in the very process of information materialising through a medium.

They see computation as a fundamental element in their practice, not merely as a tool but a material in its own right, like paint for a painter.
