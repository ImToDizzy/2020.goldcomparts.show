I am interested in our relationship to digital imagery: how we disseminate information, co-opt meaning and respond to its omnipresence. Our familiarity with the digital image and the concept of its infinite malleability are central to my work. By manipulating, re-contextualizing, and sharing we engage the image directly and offer alternate meanings.My studio practice has led me to experiment with multiple mediums and techniques and having now studied Computational Arts I am better equipped to express these ideas. I am currently investigating robotics and AI art to continue my work in the digital space adding questions of agency.
