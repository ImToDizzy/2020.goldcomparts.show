Yishuai Zhang is an artist and researcher specializing in the demystification of the entanglement between art and science. His artworks intend to explore and navigate a spectrum of dynamic resonance between organisms and machines based on the progression of his interdisciplinary research across biophysics, computation and art. He makes works in various media from painting, installations and performance, to digital and computational expressions.  His practice incorporates a consistant concern for "fluid equilibrium" and concept he conveyes though several media to create an extension of aesthetics: from the perception of visible things with natural organs to the perception of invisible things with the help of computation. His work simulates metaphysical reality to bring the meaning of art into more aspects of this current reality.
