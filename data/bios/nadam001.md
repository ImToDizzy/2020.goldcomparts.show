nathan.adams (with.lasers) adventuring in complexity and emergent behaviour, explorer of inner worlds, finding ways to express digitally that which can not be expressed easily in personâ€¦

working with open frameworks, swift + metal, max msp and any other language and tool that can be manipulated into useful forms, nathan uses particle systems and other generative schemes to explore a wide range of subjects - from deconstructing performance, to emergent behaviours in faux-physical worlds

subverting many years of designing and developing enterprise technology systems, he now brings those skills to bear in a purely creative direction
