JG Legion operates in the liminal space between question and answer, physical and computational, to develop forms that explore the concept of identity.

Finding particular inspiration in the intriguing conversations begun by the Surrealists, Legion builds life-size installations to engage the audience in an evolving discussion.

Legion's work references the ancient practice of sculpting the human figure, but employs current construction methods, and augments these with computation to create a hybrid form that interrogates the new norms of contemporary life, and their impact on conventional thinking.
