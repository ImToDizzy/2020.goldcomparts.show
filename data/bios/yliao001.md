Yu Hsuan Liao is a visual artist whose work focuses on the essential characteristics of graphics themselves by means of both mathematical precision and mathematical aesthetics.

Her works are primarily audio-visual and two-dimensional in format, alongside video art installations. Yu explores the definition of algorithm in expressing her ideas, aiming to concretely figure time and space as being infinite.

Drawing on her background in graphic design, Yu designed the visual identity of Sculpting in Motion (2017), an interactive exhibition at Taipei Fine Arts Museum.
