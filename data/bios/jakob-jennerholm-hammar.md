# Artist Bio

Jakob Jennerholm Hammar is an audio visual artist working within an ever
expanding area of interests. The translation and communication between
different media and technologies is central within his practice. Processes of
transformation and change are explored in a multitude of ways, as in the
passing of digital data and generative designs to broken analogue machinery,
bodily movements to computational systems or the transfer of synthesized
electronic signals to screens, paper and textiles. The materials and
technological familiars conjured are encouraged to leave their marks as
collaborators, co-creating in never ending feedback loops and conversations.
A background in live visuals and interactive art initiated an experimental
approach to technology and artistic explorations. Inquiries always made
alongside questions of fate, agency and responsibility.
