Through a multimedia practice that encompasses geometry and pattern making, Daniah tackles notions 
of the unobtrusive, the ordinary, and the common. By deconstructing and rearranging familiar
objects and ideas, she makes the invisible visible, manifesting a space for reflection that prompts new
perspectives and ways of seeing. Systems shape both subject and methodology, as she maps networks
and structures from language and social orders. Crossing disciplines, her explorations include traditional 
mediums of painting  combined with generative  computational processes .
