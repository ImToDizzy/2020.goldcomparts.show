## Callum Fowler

Callum Fowler works at the intersection between technology, generative art, and music. His work explores topics surrounding human-computer interactions and relationships. These themes tend to appear to humanise technology or to create novel experiences using technology.

Having a background in audio technology and composition, Callum specialises in audio-visual installations and performances. Over the past year he has also expanded into visual/interactive/web art. Notable works include: [_My Ecology_](https://callumfowler101.github.io/portfolio.html#my_ecology), [_The Happy Computer_](https://callumfowler101.github.io/portfolio.html#happy_computer), [_Human and Computer_](https://callumfowler101.github.io/portfolio.html#human_computer).

Callum is also interested in building software for artists to use. Currently he is working on [_Orbs_](https://callumfowler101.github.io/portfolio.html#orbs), a midi visualiser that can be used with digital midi devices. He has also built other mini applications for generative design.
