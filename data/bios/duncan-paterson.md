A conceptual artist and creative director, Duncan Paterson aspires to be a multispecies storyteller and an anti-correlationist. This is (and will always be) work in progress.


He’s exhibited in group shows including Fluid: London (Espacio Gallery, 2019), which transferred to Berlin (The Ballery, 2019); Romart Biennale (Rome, 2018), The Grid Art Fair, London (2018) Red Dot Art Fair, Miami (2016), and The Other Art Fair, London (2016); and was commissioned to make installations for The Secret Garden Party Festival (2016).


Most recently, he’s been inspired, elevated and humbled by an ongoing collaboration with offworlder artist collective 0rphan Drift.


His concerns right now are: what does it feel like to be a non-human thing? How can we decolonise and de-humanise art? Are computers magic? Can algorithms be spirits? He has lots of questions. Answers may or may not happen.


What would he wish for if he died and was allowed to live again? He would ask to be a crow. Or an octopus.
