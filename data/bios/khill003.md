Analysis paralysis, overthinking.

 The antithesis of Kris  Cirkuit's formidable approach to getting the job done. Abiding by the motto "Better complete than perfect." she hates writing artist statements, preferring to concentrate on actually producing the work.
 
Coming from a post-punk background, she is an electronic musician, sonic artist and coder. Her work is often loud, brightly coloured, and anything but BLAND.  
 
Her recent work examines the contrast between her internal state and the external realities and limitations. She has exhibited with the Wellcome Collection, and Deptford Does Art and has recently started a record label.
 
Kris is a long-term resident of Hackney, London. Hackney, with its history of resistance, and counter-culture, is a strong influence upon her and her work.
