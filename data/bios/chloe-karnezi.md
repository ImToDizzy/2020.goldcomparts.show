Her current work incorporates interactivity and touches upon issues such as body dysmorphia and intensive animal farming. 
Her most recent research project is a multispecies investigation into human interruptions of dairy cow technologies. 
Chloe designs audio reactive visuals for dream pop band Anemi, and has shown her work in exhibitions such as 2020's "Push, Pop, Repeat," and "Can You See My Screen?"

computation by designing sets for theatre that incorporate digital elements.
