Shuai Xu is a Chinese creative coder and new media artist currently based in London.

Shuai works with computation as a medium and language to investigate the collisions between computational arts, science, and new media technology.

His work with emerging technologies bridges communication between traditional narrative language and computational language, focuses on this interactive relationship between immersive environments and intelligent digital systems. In this way, the search for digital technology and narrative expression may be able to go beyond independent feelings, potentially creating new relationships between body, environment and technology, as well as new ways to bring aesthetic consciousness among people.
