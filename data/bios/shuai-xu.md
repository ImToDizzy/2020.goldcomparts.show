<p>Shuai works with computation as a medium and language to investigate the collisions between computational arts, science, and new media technology.</p>

<p>His working with emerging technologies bridged the communication between traditional narrative language and computational language, focuses on this interaction relationship between immersive environment and intelligent digital system. In this way, the search for digital technology and narrative expression may be able to go beyond independent feelings, potentially creating new relationships between body, environment, and technology, as well as new ways to bring aesthetic consciousness among people.</p>
