The system was designed to accompany a psychogeographer on a walk. Because of COVID restriction this year, many such walks have been solitary, with only a virtual link between the walkers, and 'Walking With Data' is a system intended to provide an intelligent friend, that can re-contextualise and expand your experiences, and challenge your perceptions. Your smart phone will start to talk to you, and offer you access to data.
It downloads Javascript to your phone, which manages the interactions. It seeks data from the web using API requests, and interacts with others who are using the system at the same time.
It is intended to broaden our perceptionsespeically in areas where these are enigmatic, such a geomagnetism,  and also to build social interaction. It uses the Big Five personality scales to assess the likes and dislikes of users, and tries to understand them better.
It is very much a 'work in progress', and was first tested out at this year's 4th World Congress of Psychogeography.
