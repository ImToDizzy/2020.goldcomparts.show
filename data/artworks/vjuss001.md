Museum of Borderlands is an interactive sound installation that explores algorithmic decision-making in physical space. It takes the form of a contemporary bestiary and iterative museum that seeks to map our current fears.

At the heart of the work is a deep learning model that has been trained on image bank photos. It seeks to spot contemporary monsters: visual representations of viruses and surveillance. Another deep learning model has been trained on anxieties that people are sharing on these topics on Reddit and Twitter. New narratives based on this corpus are heard while museum makes its classifications. 

With the installation, Veera seeks to create a place for contemplating our current fears and sources of comfort. The work invites us to explore what becomes labelled as a threat and what kind of new connections are born when images are increasingly grouped by their similar form by machine vision. By exposing the dataset, Veera invites audience to explore the limits of the museumâ€™s current knowledge and to reclassify its collection for the next training round. 

Seeing monsters as something yet-to-be, Museum of Borderlands explores the fluidness of categories in a time of mixed signals.
