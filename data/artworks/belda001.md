Programmoire engages with a mathematical artefact, the magic square, applying to its inherently computational logic a sorting algorithm that parses through all its permutations. The work is also informed by the tradition of making grimoires, taking the practice of recording elements, recipes and rituals and augmenting it into a programmable processes that find magic squares and studies their structure across one, two and three dimensions to record the emergent patterns, geometries and forms within them.
