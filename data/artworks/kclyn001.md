*_MAGICBOX_* is a multiuser virtual world which uses low-fi web technologies to allow participants to engage in choreographic world-building. Through the use of a phone or a laptop users can enter the world of *_MAGICBOX_*. Upon arrival they can explore the ruins of the world left behind by past visitors, create new structures and shrines or even tear down whatever is remaining. The world is constantly in flux, and although the foundations remain the same, the world undergoes dynamic and drastic changes. This work acts as a queering of Keirâ€™s childhood gaming influences (such as Age of Empires and Minecraft) by reformatting these inherently heteronormative game worlds whilst bringing to light how many queer communities have flourished within the confides of virtual worlds.
