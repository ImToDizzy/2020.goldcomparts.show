Cosmic Mourn was produced by George Simms as an exploration into making new sorts of digital instruments. Looking at the way we figure sound and music into hierarchies and transforming these into an embodied full body experience.

The piece reflects on the space between, filling these empty voids with the richness of organic sound. Thinking about Karen Barad's ideas of materiality and the constructed borders of matter and phenomena. Transferring the energy of the point or planet to the space between, bringing life to what was once empty. Using AR in this way moves the viewer from a static position where the universe unfolds around them, to one where it is produced through their interactions, both known and unknown.

The sounds are from a recorded  session of improvised singing done in collaboration with Izzy Nahkla. She is a long time friend and on the day we were both quite anxious about the world and life. From this moment we produced this selection of sounds, forming this mournful choral and with it a space to reflect through exploration. Creating space and time outside of our own, looking back to build up and grow.
