My work is an installation consisting of five independent screens. It contains vision and sound. It is a project about expressing the stream of consciousness. The different images and videos represent different images that appear in the mind, so in some ways this is an expression of the steam of consciousness that I have in head. The visual part is mainly done with MAX/JITTER, I use MAX/JITTER to process the videos I recorded before, and recorded a video of me interacting with computer. Also, there have audiovisual images produced by TouchDesigner. About my audio part, I use MAX/MSP to process the samples I recorded and add some music samples to form the sound.
