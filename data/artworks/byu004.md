The project mainly explored more possibilities of visualization: that is, data visualization can not only convey objective facts and analytical data, but also convey the emotion behind the data rather than pure rational information.

The project is extended based on Robert Plutchik's emotional model, and emotional data is extracted from expression information and action behavior information, and emotional information is transmitted in a visual manner.

The purpose is to enable people to make more optimized and more humane understanding and decision-making through emotional data transmission, and to propose more possibilities for data visualization.
