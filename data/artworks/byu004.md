The name of this project is Kaleidoscope, which is an interactive projection. It mainly explores the possibility of visualization in terms of emotion: that is, data visualization can not only convey objective facts and analytical data, but also convey the emotion behind the data rather than pure rational information.

The project uses the emotional visualization subject of "Emotional Computing" and Robert Plutchik's emotional model as the theoretical basis. It extends the theory of "emotional intelligence machine" mentioned in "The Society of Mind". And use the open source library of face-api, train the algorithm for obtaining emotion through expression information, combine the action behavior information, the data to perform a certain degree of emotional mechanism analysis, and use the visual way to transmit emotional information.

This project is to provide people with an emotional data visualization experience, guide the audience to experience the transmission of emotions behind the data, and feel the aesthetics of visualization. And put forward the possibility that visualization with emotions can help people make more optimized and ideal solutions.
