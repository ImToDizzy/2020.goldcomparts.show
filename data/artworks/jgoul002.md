Can you see me? Really see me? Or am I still invisible?

Come closer (not too close!) and look. Just stop and look. Now think about who you are seeing. First impressions? No, we need to go much deeper.

Thanks to the virus, our heightened awareness of proximity and the physical presence of others is where it should have been all along, at the heart of every personal interaction. 

This requires of us an attempt to set aside any built-in bias and preconceived ideas, and engage in a far more subtle, nuanced visual conversation, to understand more clearly who we are conversing with and what they are trying to communicate to us.

Such multilayered thinking also demands that we look deep inside ourselves, which in turn prompts us to open our minds to encompass the bigger picture.

Look, see, think. And remember.
