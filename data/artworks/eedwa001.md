Co-produced is a technical exploration that forms part of a wider body of work by the artist in an investigation into the relationship sphere of the art object, interrogating the bonds between the art object, the audience and the artist. This piece in particular is the result of the artist’s intentions to expand their technical skills to enable them to reframe the potential of future art objects and artistic outcomes.

The format of web app that is used widens the scope of engagement opportunities beyond the boundaries in which the work is physically enclosed. The chosen platform is a direct reflection of a previous work in this series, *doNOTtouch* (2020), available on the artist’s Vimeo [https://vimeo.com/eleanoredwards], which focused around a single physical point of interaction and therefore the Art Object:Audience relationship was restricted to localised engagement. Co-produced goes beyond this through its media, utilising the flexibility of the web which by its nature allows for a wider reach in connections,. Through this the Audience is able to bring the Art Object to them - changing the power dynamic within the relationship sphere.
