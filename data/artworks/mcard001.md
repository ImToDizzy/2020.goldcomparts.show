A physical-digital installation that generates poems in real-time. Pieces of data are combined to create short, free-verse compositions about 2020. 

Each poem is a random three-part combination of a tweet that mentions the current year, a relevant headline from The Guardian since last January and words from the Wikipedia 2020's page.

A mini thermal printer is connected with a Raspberry Pi to print the poems using Javascript and Node.js. The algorithm makes requests to each API using specific parameters which are returned as text. In addition to the physical object, an interactive website allow the user to generate and view the content in a digital format.

Inspired by the explosive growth of social media usage over the past months during the quarantine.
