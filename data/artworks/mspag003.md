*Sistema 1* is a performance that explores the fallibility of human cognition. By means of a continuous series of optical and auditory illusions, the audience is left with no time to rationalize what they are experiencing and hence forced to perceive the piece through the eyes of a child, overlooking rationality and embracing naivety. The goal of the performance is to keep the audience trapped within the confines of cognitive System 1, which operates on a “What is you is all there is” basis, as described in the Nobel-prize-winning theory by Psychologist Daniel Kahneman.
