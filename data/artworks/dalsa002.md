The installation explores the process and mechanism of memory making in the presence of media influences. How the constant flux of images in media impacts, interferes and intrudes with memory preservation in particular within the context of cultural identity.

“How do I remember Thee” is influenced by the framework of cultural theorist Stuart’s Hall philosophy of coding and decoding discourse. The piece situates itself as a commentary on how the archival memories of the past is being slowly distorted by images in contemporary political culture informed by different modes of media.

The installation consists of Three screens that uses Three different types of AI generative models: 

Screen 1: StyleGAN2 model (Nvidia) which has been trained on a unique dataset and generates deep fakes. 
Screen 2: Deep fakes manipulated by First Order_motion_model paper (Siarohin Et al)
Screen 3:  Contemporary Images manipulated by sinGAN model (Shaham Et al)
