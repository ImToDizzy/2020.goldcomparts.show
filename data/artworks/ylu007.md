This work explores a new process of creativity generation under the guide of Jordanous’s Four PPPPerspectives (2016) and speculates intertwined relationships among multi-contributors in computational creativity. This work can also be seen as an experimental multispecies storytelling on creativity. 

This experiment collected the images from OpenProcessing community as training samples and fed them into styleGAN (a novel generative adversarial network (GAN) introduced by Nvidia) to generate many images. Then these images are postprocessed as environment-driven interactive moving images by optical flow algorithm. 

In this computational system, it is speculated that humans are inspiring themselves and that all other nonegos are used as bridges and catalysts in a closed loop, to some extent. I hope this work can motivate audiences to think about the definition of creativity and reflect on human’s unique ability on creation by comparing with machine and nature’s creative abilities.
