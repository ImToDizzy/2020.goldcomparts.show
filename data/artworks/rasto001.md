Grounded in a shifting terrain, living in the sediments of the past, disorientation becomes the only thing to hold onto. *Ground* is a Virtual Reality piece that celebrates groundlessness and change, claiming disorientation as a positive state to feel your way into or through. Within the work, texture is used as a way to rethink a ground—the present moment—that is in constant flux, steeped in history and memory. As texture exists at the border of sight, touch and sound it becomes a device to recall and remix time and space. *Ground* uses the medium of Virtual Reality to think about perception and embodiment. Following a meandering line through abstract painting, color theory, minimalist sculpture and light art, *Ground* uses abstraction, light and the relationship between bodies and the worlds they are perceiving. A gaze controller allows a user to change and animate the virtual world by moving their head and looking around, which results in visual and aural textures that build up to a synaesthetic and embodied experience. The work is appearing as a performative demonstration within the *Chimera Garden* exhibition.
