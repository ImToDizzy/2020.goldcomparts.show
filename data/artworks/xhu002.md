"After the game is before the game." 

Run Run is an experience roaming game made by Unity. The visual part is made up of Unity and Processing: the scene of Unity is the dream / reality part of "real", while the scene of Processing is the abstract feeling and mental experience of the running character. The soundtrack of the game is made by Max. 

What if tomorrow is today? There is no tomorrow, tomorrow is today, always today. So is today a dream or a reality? Always in the same state, seeing fixed buildings, meeting the same people, watching them do the same thing. No matter how much the man runs, these people and things will appear meticulously in accordance with the order. Do not stop exploring, keep moving on today, until the game starts all over again, “the end of all our exploring will be to arrive where we started.” Explore each of the same “today”, anything different is good. 

The only thing that cannot be changed is that destiny must be fought for in the run.
