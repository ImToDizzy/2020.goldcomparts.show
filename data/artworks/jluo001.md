This work is composed of 5 musical instrument, each of which is visualized as a painting. It is amazing that most of the songs are arranged by different instruments, and the effects of a single instrument and their ensemble are very different. This work allows everyone to control the playing or not of the instrument to show the charm of music and at the same time turn what the instrument sings into a painting.
 
This work is mainly written using openFrameworks, using the audio material of 5 musical instruments in a song. How to respectively calculate and visualize the 5 audio used as screen elements is also the biggest difficulty and breakthrough of the work. The final picture is composed of 5 elements, which also implies the complementarity of musical instruments.
 
This work is a good demonstration of the ensemble way the band plays music,and also uses interaction to let everyone feel the charm firsthand. No matter who you are, you will probably be attracted to it.
