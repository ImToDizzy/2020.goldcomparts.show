In Daniel Quinn’s novel ‘Ishmael’, an interspecific dialogue unfolds between a jellyfish and a gorilla. The conversation is about the evolution of different spices. As a result, jellyfish is considered to be a pinnacle of the evolutionary process because they proceed strictly on the basis of ‘observation, logic and the scientific method’. Their 96 percent water entities mock at the omnipresent aggrandisement of human beings as the essence of all creatures. Jellyfish are bio-machines, emotional AI and a multi-layered interconnected conscious web.
With the help of computation, ‘All is a transient dream’ simulates a temporal-spatial dialogue  between ‘gorilla’ and ‘jellyfish’, physical and virtual, organisms and machines, hence in this project, performers and an interactive system that materialises itself through the imitation of jellyfish as well as the dancing motion of the performers. This interactive performance intends to illustrate a dynamic relationship between organisms and machines through a series of visual effects, improvised dancing and tailored soundtrack.
