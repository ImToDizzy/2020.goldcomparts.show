Liminal Dream is an interactive audio-spatial experience that takes you on a sonic journey as you walk through a virtual space. As the mouse/keyboard/screen trio has become second nature to any human in the digital age, this piece invites you to enter through this most mundane means of interaction through the screen space and headphones. The environment is built in Unity and the sound is interactive through communications with Max/Msp. 
Instead of experiencing music in a fixed time frame, the spatial exploration allows you to disrupt the linear nature of the object identified as a “soundtrack” and re-create the structure of a sound piece. You start bringing out different sonic elements as you travel through the paths at your own pace. In the meantime, you may be transported to an alternative version of the space.
Using the game platform is a medium from which we often seek alternative experience than the present, Liminal Dream is an exploration of the concept of **liminal space**, where our brain temporarily ceased to be able to grasp the entire context while encountered with familiar sense input.
