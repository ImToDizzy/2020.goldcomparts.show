Digital weavings hang from the wall, burnt onto paper with a thermal printer. The patterns are constructed through algorithmic procedures and emergent systems encountered and interacted with through bodily movements. They are the proposed results of generative weaving drafts or notations. Drafts used as navigational tools, as codified images of a process or maps visualizing the setup and operation of a weaving loom to create suggested structures and patterns. They are studies of the vivid connections between weaving and digital technology, of fate, agency, responsibility and necessity. A reflection on the tensity of living and creating while having little or no control yet participating in and constantly influencing all of oneâ€™s surroundings.
 
Next to the prints, an installation lets the viewer co-create patterns together with a computational system, channelled through ever changing weaving drafts and printed in real time. Bodily movements, captured by a camera, can be used to navigate the operations of a digital loom and to influence emergent forces, creating unfolding patterns. The work invites you to **read** as well as **make** patterns, to participate in a process where one is never in full control of the outcome but always interfering and influencing it as part of a collective creative process. 
 
A companion website containing a set of interactive experiments and meditations on weaving drafts is also a part of the work.
